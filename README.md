### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Vinicius** and this is my personal Github account, mainly used to store learning code and ocasional side projects. No company data and/or company application are stored here.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ITEC Engenharia as a Fullstack Developer and DevOps (Sysadmin);
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and deepening my knowledge in Typescript;
- ðŸ•› Not much of a project type of person, but I like coming up with something new from time to time, even if it is for the lols.
